Question Of First_Fit_algo

=> Given five memory partitions of 100 KB, 500 KB, 200 KB, 300 KB, and 600 KB
(in order), how would each of the first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit algorithms place processes
of 212 KB, 417 KB, 112 KB, and 426 KB (in order)? Write a program in C which will print
the mapping of processes with memory partitions for both the algorithms.(for conceptual
clarity refer the textbook)
